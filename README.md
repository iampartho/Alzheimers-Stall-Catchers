# Competition Overview

Head on to the <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/65/clog-loss-alzheimers-research/page/207/">Alzheimers Stall Catchers Competition</a> website for competition details.

# Data Visualization
This is a competition of constructing a binary classifier. Model has to predict whether the given data is Stalled or Non-stalled. We think to prepare data in two ways to help model differentiating between stalled and non-stalled. 
From the perspective of point cloud, one can easily visualize and differentiate them. For instance :
A Stalled Sample : ![Stalled sample](screenshots/stalled.JPG)

A Non-Stalled Sample : ![Non-Stalled sample](screenshots/nonstalled.JPG)


# Solution Approach

The proposed solution method primarily comprises of two major pipelines:
 1. Image based approach 
 2. Point cloud based approach
 
Several deep learning classifier models have tested in both approaches, including ResNet, DenseNet, ResNet 3D and several other 3D convolution based models. Implementation details on any model tried and tested on the dataset has been further discussed in detail in the sub directories of the repository. In 'Point Cloud Based Approach' you can find all detailed code for point cloud based approach codes and in 'Image Based Approach' you can find all detailed code for image based approach.

The final submission of the competition was done on the ensemble of best models of the two major pipelines. Ensemble scheme has also been explained in detail.

# Repository Overview

# Getting Started

* # Point Cloud Based Approach
- Firstly run the code to generate point cloud from the video data. Code can be found in 'Dataset Visualization and Processing' folder.
```bash
python dataset_generator.py
```
- Then to train you have to run the <a href="https://github.com/ClockWorkKid/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Point%20Cloud%20Based%20Approach/Pointcloud_training_resnet_densenet.ipynb">notebook</a> from 'Point Cloud Based Approach' folder for DenseNet, ResNet model. Or run this <a href="https://github.com/ClockWorkKid/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Point%20Cloud%20Based%20Approach/Train_3DptCloud_clsballoss.ipynb">notebook</a> for ResNext, Wide_ResNet model. 

- Lastly, for inferencing you have to run <a href="https://github.com/ClockWorkKid/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Point%20Cloud%20Based%20Approach/Pointcloud_inference_resnet_densenet.ipynb">notebook</a> from 'Point Cloud Based Approach' folder for DenseNet, ResNet model. Or run this <a href="https://github.com/ClockWorkKid/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Point%20Cloud%20Based%20Approach/Inference_3DptCloud.ipynb">notebook</a> for ResNext, Wide_ResNet model inference. All the notebooks were used in google colab. So you can modify it to use in your local machine. 

* # Image Based Approach
- First create a folder naming your dataset (e.g "micro") and keep all the videos in that folder.
- Then place [this](https://github.com/iampartho/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Image%20Based%20Approach/extract_frames_new.py) code on the directory of your dataset folder and open terminal and run the following code
```
python extract_frames_new.py --dataset_name micro
```
- It will create a new folder name **"micro_frames"** which will have the extracted video frames with the region of interest
- Make a zip of that folder and upload it to your **google drive** (in order to use the [training notebook](https://github.com/iampartho/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Image%20Based%20Approach/training_notebook.ipynb) and train our algorithm in google colab)
- Create some folds of your own or use [this](https://github.com/iampartho/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/tree/master/Image%20Based%20Approach/traintestlist) folder for either reference or use. Then make a zip of that folder and upload it to your google drive
- Finally use [this](https://github.com/iampartho/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Image%20Based%20Approach/training_notebook.ipynb) notebook and google colab to conduct your training. Details of every cell of the training code can be found [here](https://github.com/iampartho/Alzheimers-Stall-Catchers/blob/master/Image%20Based%20Approach/README.md)
